TODO

2. somehow modify what was spent... maybe instead of adding to a continuous sum we put in each entry as a UID child under the meal
3. pull up to refresh dashboard and trip
4. override back button to go where it's supposed to
5. prevent multiple trips from having the same name... messes up the dictionary w/ IDs
