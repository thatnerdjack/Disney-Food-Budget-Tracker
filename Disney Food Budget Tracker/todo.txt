TODO

2. somehow modify what was spent... maybe instead of adding to a continuous sum we put in each entry as a UID child under the meal
5. prevent multiple trips from having the same name... messes up the dictionary w/ IDs
6. add ability to upload picture of reciept
7. sort dashboard by check in date

add-meal-v2 branch:
1. total up $$ spent with new system (let's try adapting it)
2. show details screen?
